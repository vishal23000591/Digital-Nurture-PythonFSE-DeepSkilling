# Step 59:
# The N+1 query problem occurs when one query retrieves
# N records and then N additional queries are executed
# to fetch related data.
#
# In this example:
# N+1 Version = 13 queries
# Optimized JOIN Version = 1 query
#
# In a real application with 10,000 enrollments,
# the N+1 approach would execute 10,001 queries,
# causing significant performance issues.
#
# The JOIN approach retrieves the same data
# using only a single query.
